This folder contains code building models predicting fire severity and canopy cover and basal area change with fire.  There is a code for each of the satellite indices and sensor combinations we evaluated.  I wrote these as separate codes, and not a loop due to the need to rename/replace a variety of things in the code for each iteration.
