These are my not-so-eloquent code to accomplish geoprocessing required for building models with these satellite index data.  
This code masks the rasters, mosaicks them, smooths the data, and extracts values to plot locations.  
There is separate code for processing Landsat vs. Sentinel data. I ran into issues mosaicking the Sentinel2 data, so did that in ArcMap.
